# It took me a while to figure out what dB was but I learned that it has to stay below 0 so it wont damage speakers. But also it was describe to depend on a threshold. Some articles stated that hearing a whisper is 30dB while a motorcycle is -20dB so the more negative it is, the louder the noise level is. Other articles said that 0 is silence. This shows that dB is a relative measurement but I will criticize this as 0 being silent and as the value goes down the more loud it is.

#Conclusion: 

# The purpose of this project was to compare the Genres to BPM(beats per minute), NRGY(energy), dB(loudness) and acoustic. I did this by dividing the Genres into two different categories "Pop Genres" and "Other Genres." I wanted to see how both categories will compare to the different music elements. For BPM, both categories seemed to be mixed, with not many similarities between the sub genres. Overall the category "Other Genres" had a higher BPM. When I compared the categories to NRGY, there seemed to be a similar level between the Pop Genre category. Meanwhile, the sub genres in the Other Genre categories had different NRGY levels. This showed that Pop Genres have a similar NRGY level. Next I compared the categories to the dB. There didnt seem to be a correlation between the sub genres and its category. Both the British Soul and Latin had the lowest and highest dB level. They were both from the Other Genres Category. Lastly I compared the categories with the Acoustic level. The Pop Genre Category had low levels while the Other Genre Category was mixed. 

#It was impressing to see how each music element factored into the genres. There seemed to be a similar level in the Pop Genre sub genres with dB and NRGY. Meanwhile the Other Genre category didnt have many similarities.
